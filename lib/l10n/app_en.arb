	"petraHistoryInfo1": "The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000  BCE, and the Nabataeans might have settled in what would become the capital city of their kingdom as early as the 4th century BCE.\nThe trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable revenue and Petra became the focus of their wealth. The Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts, unlike their enemies, and were able to repel attacks by taking advantage of the area's mountainous terrain.",
	"petraHistoryInfo2": "Petra flourished in the 1st century CE, when its famous Al-Khazneh structure - believed to be the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV - was constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.\nAccess to the city is through a 3/4 mile-long (1.2 km) gorge called the Siq, which leads directly to the Khazneh.",
	"petraConstructionInfo1": "Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system, Petra is also called the \"Red Rose City\" because of the color of the stone from which it is carved.\nAnother thing Petra is known for is its Hellenistic (“Greek”) architecture. These influences can be seen in many of the facades at Petra and are a reflection of the cultures that the Nabataens traded with.",
	"petraConstructionInfo2": "The facade of the Treasury features a broken pediment with a central tholos (“dome”) inside, and two obelisks appear to form into the rock of Petra at the top. Near the bottom of the Treasury we see twin Greek Gods: Pollux, Castor, and Dioscuri, who protect travelers on their journeys. \nNear the top of the Treasury, two victories are seen standing on each side of a female figure on the tholos. This female figure is believed to be the Isis-Tyche, Isis being the Egyptian Goddess and Tyche being the Greek Goddess of good fortune.",

	"petraLocationInfo2": "The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and the Nabataeans might have settled in what would become the capital city of their kingdom as early as the 4th century BC.\nArchaeological work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second century BC, by which time Petra had become their capital.

	"pyramidsGizaHistoryInfo2": "The pyramids of Giza and others are thought to have been constructed to house the remains of the deceased pharaohs who ruled over Ancient Egypt. A portion of the pharaoh's spirit called his ka was believed to remain with his corpse. Proper care of the remains was necessary in order for the former Pharaoh to perform his new duties as king of the dead.",
	"pyramidsGizaConstructionInfo1": "Most construction theories are based on the idea that the pyramids were built by moving huge stones from a quarry and dragging and lifting them into place. In building the pyramids, the architects might have developed their techniques over time.\nThey would select a site on a relatively flat area of bedrock — not sand — which provided a stable foundation. After carefully surveying the site and laying down the first level of stones, they constructed the pyramids in horizontal levels, one on top of the other.",
	"pyramidsGizaConstructionInfo2": "For the Great Pyramid, most of the stone for the interior seems to have been quarried immediately to the south of the construction site. The smooth exterior of the pyramid was made of a fine grade of white limestone that was quarried across the Nile.\nTo ensure that the pyramid remained symmetrical, the exterior casing stones all had to be equal in height and width. Workers might have marked all the blocks to indicate the angle of the pyramid wall and trimmed the surfaces carefully so that the blocks fit together. During construction, the outer surface of the stone was smooth limestone; excess stone has eroded as time has passed.",
	"pyramidsGizaLocationInfo1": "The site is at the edges of the Western Desert, approximately 5.6 miles (9 km) west of the Nile River in the city of Giza, and about 8 miles (13 km) southwest of the city center of Cairo.",
